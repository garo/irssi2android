Irssi2Android - send notifications from irssi to your Android phone
===================================================================

This simple script allows you to get notifications about your private messages from irssi to your Android phone. Currently this supports only the Notify My Android (www.notifymyandroid.com) api. The NMA application costs currently around 3.5 eur.

The script sends events only when you have not done anything (pressed any buttons) for a predefined idle time (Default 30, tune with /set irssi2android_idletime <minutes>). In my opinion this is much better than depending on your /away status.

I'd suggest that you also use the excellent Irssi Connectbot: https://market.android.com/details?id=org.woltage.irssiconnectbot

Installation
============

1) Copy the irssi2android.pl under your scripts directory (Usually ~/.irssi/scripts).
2) Load the script: /script load irssi2android
3) Set your NMA apikey: /set irssi2android_nma_api 123456789abcdef
4) Send a test message: /irssi2android Hello, World!

Commands:
=========
/set irssi2android_nma_api         <API_KEY>              (Default NULL)
/set irssi2android_general_hilight <on/off>               (Default OFF)
/set irssi2android_idletime        <idle time in minutes> (Default 30)

/irssi2android <message, sends a test message thru the api>

"General hilight" basically referrs to ALL the hilights you have
added manually in irssi, if many, it can get really bloated if
turned on. Default is Off.

You will need the following packages:
LWP::UserAgent (You can install this using cpan -i LWP::UserAgent)
Crypt::SSLeay  (You can install this using cpan -i Crypt::SSLeay)
 
Or if you're using Debian GNU/Linux:
apt-get update;apt-get install libwww-perl libcrypt-ssleay-perl

Bugs & Missing Features:
========================

If you receive a private message just after you have closed your screen and left to get fresh air, you won't get a notification because the idle time hasn't yet passed. The script could store these messages in a buffer and send a notification to your phone when the required idle time has passed.
